              With a strong background in <strong>React, TypeScript, Django</strong>, and UI/UX principles, I specialize in building engaging, responsive interfaces and scalable solutions. I blend modern tools like <strong>Framer Motion</strong>, <strong>Bootstrap</strong>, and <strong>Vite</strong> to create sleek, interactive user experiences that stand out.

            <p>
              I'm currently pursuing a degree in <strong>Computer Engineering</strong>, which has deepened my understanding of software architecture, system design, and programming fundamentals. Alongside my formal education, Iâ€™ve continuously invested in building real-world projects and mastering technologies beyond the classroom â€” refining both my technical and problem-solving abilities through hands-on development.
            </p>
            <p>
              Whether it's bringing a product idea to life, optimizing a frontend interface, or collaborating with teams to ship polished web solutions, I bring reliability, efficiency, and a commitment to excellence in every project.
            </p>
            <p>
              Iâ€™m actively open to collaboration, freelance work, and exciting challenges. Letâ€™s connect and create something impactful.
